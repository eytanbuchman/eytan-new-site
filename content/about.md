A little bit more about me…
From the military to high-tech, I’ve been at the intersection of storytelling and digital amplification for some time now. If you want the full story, read on. You can read some articles that have been written about my marketing (I, II).



I'm originally from Chicago and livein Israel with my wife and three incredible kids. I have a background in strategic communication, PR and excessice coookie baking. 

I'm a major in reservces in the Israel Defense Forces where I served as the Spokesperson to North American Media,  crafting and conveying strategic messaging to the largest media and production companies in the world, from Buzzfeed to the Wall Street Journal and National Geographic to CNN. I also served some other roles that aren't as interesting.

## But let's talk marketing
I always loved tech. I didn't always love freight. Now I like both. Heck, the New York Times called me a `freight nerd` and I was good with it. 

I run marketing at Freightos, a digitial freight booking platform that I scaled from a <10 person company to a Nasdaq-traded global platform that - in some countries - handles over 20% of cargo in our scope. I love being hands on while making space for ny outstanding team to take the lead. I head up full marketing stack operations, from positioning and branding to digital and traditional marketing channels. I have a data-driven marketing approach, with an emphasis on content marketing, analyst relations, press engagements and online customer journeys.

I also like to help businesses and organizations get their feet wet with strategic positioning and branding, as well as social media and marketing strategies. If that's interesting, reach out to me [here](/contact)
