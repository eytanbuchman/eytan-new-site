Just came across this gem of an ad campaign for the NY Lottery. Fantastic
visual style and incredible copy that has you thinking like you might like to
think a billionaire thinks. I (think) I love it.

I’m glad I didn’t come across this when it came out, letting me discover it
now. There is just something about the sparse visual horizon that draws you
into the character’s psyche. This is all win.
