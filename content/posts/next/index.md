Marketing conferences are fluff. Or usually are.

Which is why I appreciate NextCase’s approach – a series of twenty minute case
studies, focusing on things that actually worked. The following is the deck [I
presented at the event this year](https://www.nextcase.co.il/en/program),
focusing on account-based content distribution and a methodology for low-cost
leads at scale from pre-defined target audiences.

Oh, the title? **How one report drove engagement from 50% of our total
addressable market​.**
