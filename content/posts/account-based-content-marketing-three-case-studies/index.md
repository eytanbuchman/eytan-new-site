B2B is hard.

[Getting attention](https://www.buchman.co.il/life-for-marketers-is-about-to-
get-harder-heres-why/), especially from senior decision makers, is down-right
impossible. And outbound sales just isn’t the way to go. So while buyers are
building up castle walls to push back against the attention-grabbers, most
marketers are responding with brute force, trying to knock down the walls.

What if you could get someone to open up the gates instead?

Account-based marketing is the art (yes, art) of doubling-down on key
prospects and companies, creating an incredibly compelling customer journey so
they practically slide down a WD40’d Slip-n-Slide into your product.

And one of the best ways to support that is by leveraging account-based
content. Well.

## And wouldn’t you know it.

That’s exactly what I spoke about at [Content
Israel](http://contentisrael.com) 2018 in November 2018, a great conference
dedicated to actionable content marketing tips. And in order to share the
love, here’s the slide deck I used.
