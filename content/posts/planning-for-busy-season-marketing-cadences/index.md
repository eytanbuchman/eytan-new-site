I’m a big believer in just shipping. Not necessarily freight (although I do
like that too).

Nearly all of the projects I’ve worked on that _didn’t_ work had an element of
over-production or effort that could have been avoided if I had compromised (a
bit) on quality and then iterated.

In other words, if you’re working on a new marketing project, the best time to
launch is usually **now**.

But as you evolve any given concept, timing starts to play more important
role.

I recently gave a quick presentation about timing marketing activities around
busy season, how to build up a cadence in advance, and the best way to get in
front of prospects when the going gets tough.

There are charts and everything, so you know it’s legit.

Thanks to Marketing Envy for the opportunity. Also, if you have a second,
check out [this amazing
presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=511x0AgG7dY) about ABM/Interest
targeting Merav at CATO Networks gave. I loved it.
